👋 Hi, I’m Rohan Posane — a Quality Engineering (Test) Analyst with 4+ years of experience turning complex testing challenges into reliable, automated solutions.

🧪 I design and implement automation frameworks for UI, API, and ETL testing using Java, C#, Python, and tools like Selenium, SpecFlow, Postman, and NUnit.

🔄 I thrive in Agile teams, streamline CI/CD pipelines, and work closely with developers to make sure applications break in testing — not in production.

🏅 Recognized multiple times for mentoring, technical contributions, and solving problems before they become issues.

🤖 On the side, I’ve been diving into AI and machine learning, working on practical projects and exploring how tools like GenAI and copilots can support smarter testing and development workflows.

Always testing with intent, breaking with purpose, and building with quality in mind.
